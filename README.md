# 🧪 A/B Testing Plan: Evaluating the Impact of UX Design Changes  
### (Amazon, Walmart, Target)

This section outlines how to scientifically validate the impact of proposed design improvements using **A/B testing**, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

---

# 🎯 Objectives & High-Level Questions

- Validate whether each design change improves **business-relevant metrics**, such as:
  - Conversion rate  
  - Add-to-Cart rate  
  - Checkout completion  
  - Average Order Value (AOV)  
  - Time-to-first-action  

- Measure the impact on **qualitative outcomes**:
  - Task completion success  
  - SUS (System Usability Scale) scores  
  - User-reported satisfaction  

---

# 🧩 Hypotheses (Examples)

### **Amazon (H1)**  
Decluttered product header (price + CTA above the fold) will increase **Add-to-Cart rate by 10%** (relative lift).

### **Walmart (H2)**  
Inline cart editing + reordered cart layout will reduce **cart abandonment rate by 10%** (relative).

### **Target (H3)**  
Reducing skeleton-loading duration and exposing usable filters will increase **product-detail engagement (PD pageviews/session)** by **8%** (relative).

---

# 📊 Primary Metrics (Per Site)

### **Amazon**
- **Primary:** Add-to-Cart rate  
- PDP → Checkout rate  
- PDP bounce rate  

### **Walmart**
- **Primary:** Checkout completion rate  
- Cart edit rate  
- Time-to-checkout  

### **Target**
- **Primary:** Product-detail engagement  
- Filter usage rate  
- LCP/FID performance improvements (mobile + desktop)

---

# 🧪 Experiment Design

- Randomized **A/B (1:1)** controlled experiment  
- Randomization unit: **user**, not session  
- Randomization key: first-party cookie or logged-in user ID  
- Stratified by:
  - Device type (mobile/desktop)  
  - New vs returning users  
  - Acquisition source  

- Exclusions:
  - Internal IPs  
  - QA/test accounts  
  - Bot traffic  

- Ensure consistent time windows for A and B variants.

---

# 📐 Sample Size Calculations  
*(Two-sided test, α = 0.05, power = 0.80)*

### Required users **per group** to detect a **10% relative lift**:

| Baseline Conversion | Required n (per variant) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **2.0%**           | **~80,682** users        |
| **5.0%**           | **~31,234** users        |
| **10.0%**          | **~14,751** users        |

> Lower baseline conversion → larger sample required for equal lift detection.

---

# 🎛 Segmentation & Blocking

Run A/B tests across key user segments:

- Mobile vs Desktop  
- Membership tiers (Prime / Walmart+ / Target Circle)  
- High-intent vs browsing sessions  
- New vs Returning users  

Check for **heterogeneous treatment effects**.

---

# 🛰 Instrumentation & Telemetry

Use analytics platforms (Segment, Amplitude, GA4, Snowplow, etc.) to track:

### **Events**
- `view_PDP`  
- `click_add_to_cart`  
- `start_checkout`  
- `checkout_complete`  

### **Exposure Logging**
- Prefer **server-side** exposure tracking  
- Add client-side guards for reliability  

### **Performance Metrics (via RUM)**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)  
- FID (First Input Delay)  
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)  

---

# 📈 Analytics & Statistical Methods

- **Two-proportion z-tests** → for binary outcomes (conversion, add-to-cart)  
- **t-tests or nonparametric tests** → for continuous metrics (AOV, time-to-action)  
- **Multiple comparison correction:** Benjamini–Hochberg FDR  
- Report:
  - Uplift %  
  - 95% Confidence Intervals  
  - p-values  

- Sequential monitoring allowed **only with alpha-spending** methods (e.g., O’Brien-Fleming).

---

# 🗣 Qualitative Validation

Combine quant + qual insights:

- Conduct **moderated usability sessions** (n = 8–12 per variant)  
- Focus on:
  - Task success  
  - Confusion points  
  - Emotional responses  
- Add open-ended feedback sessions to capture:
  - Friction points  
  - Suggestions  
  - Perceived improvements  

---


## Result:
The heuristic evaluation was completed successfully, and key usability issues were identified across navigation, design, and user control.
Clear UX improvements were proposed for enhancing overall usability.
The study demonstrates how heuristic analysis effectively improves user experience.
